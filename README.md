# Derivatives
This code repository stores the ouput of projects linked to derivatives pricing and greeks calculations via closed form formulas or numerical methods.
So far the objective is to cover a few option types and to optimize code to the extent possible. 


It is first and foremost a personal project I undertake for skill improvement. 
However, if you have any comment or suggestion, feel free to open an issue.
